<h1>Sliding Ball</h1>
<p>You are sliding or merging balls to clean up the board. The fewer steps you spend on it, the higher score you will get.</p>

<p>There's two types of balls randomly placed on a 4x4 board. The player use the arrow keys to slide this balls, which will make all balls in onr line move in the same indicated direction. The player can also apply a powerful slide which means if there's any balls of the same type in the line they can merge into one. For every game, the player is going to make the balls remain on board to 2 as fast as they can.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p><b>Start:</b> 4x4 balls will be random placed on a 4x4 board. (To make sure player can have only 2 balls on board we can use the inverse progress to generate the whole map from 2.)</p>
<p><b>Movement:</b> When the arrow keys are pressed all balls in selected line slide in the indicated direction until they are blocked by either other ball with different color or wall.<br>
If player hold the Ctrl to perform a slide, it will become a powerful slide, in which balls with the same color in a line of sliding direction will get merged and disappear until the last one</p>

<p><b>End:</b>when there's only 2 balls(of different color) remaining on the board, game finished. We can check the step player costs to calculate the score. Or if player can't further remove balls(they've already completely blocked)</p>
